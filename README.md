HTML Panel Page Creator
---------------------------------
This application was created using various librarys found throughout the internet including the following:

Usage
---------------------------------
To use the creator, simply run index.html in a browser, whether it be uploaded on a server or ran locally.

From there the default page has the editor open and has one "full panel" added. To remove the panel simply select it by clicking on it which will highlight it with a blue glow.

From there use the wysiwyg editor to create your content and press the "Update Selected Panel" button. This will apply the contents of the editor to the selected panel.

Using the left navigation menu you can add new panels and change the wallpaper.

When you are satisfied, select "Generate HTML" to start a download of your customized site.
